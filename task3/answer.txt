1) countyList and data for ContactPerson list init I would move to model layer, or even better, moved to database, for now assume that data stored as contactPersonInitData
2) I would add Linq to using list for next step
3) contactPersonList filling I would changed to contactPersonInitData.Select(x => new ContactPerson {
		Municipality = x.Municipality,
		County = x.County,
		Email = x.Email
	}) - it that way it more readable and easy to add changes. Or here may be used foreach cycle.
	
4) Some methods have annotation and some don't. I would add annotation to methods that don't have it - should be in one style
5) public class ContactPerson would moved it to model layer, why that class is here?
6) protected static methods I would moved to some static Helper class, in this case, #region Language handling methods I would move to helpers/Locale.cs
